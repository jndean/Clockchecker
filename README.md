# Clockchecker üï∞Ô∏è
Reddit user u/Not_Quite_Vertical posts [weekly Blood on the Clocktower puzzles](https://notquitetangible.blogspot.com/2024/11/clocktower-puzzle-archive.html). Clockchecker is a na√Øve solver of specifically these puzzles, which generates and checks all possible worlds. A driving motivation is for implementing new characters to be as easy as possible.

## Usage
Run the example script (which usually just contains whatever puzzle I was implementing most recently) with:
```bash
python example.py
```
All currently solved puzzles are present as unit tests in tests.py. Run them all with
```bash
python -m unittest
```
At time of writing clockchecker is written purely in Python (3.13), because it is supposed to be fun to work on and easy to reason over, rather than efficient to run. The above unittest command today solves 32 puzzles in 10.1 seconds.

## Example Character Implementations
The hope is for characters to be easy to write, easy to read, and easy to reason over. TPI is determined to make this goal unattainable. That said, at least _some_ characters fit quite well in the clockchecker framework; some example characters taken from the `characters.py` file are below.

Reasoning over the output of character information is done using `STBool`s (StoryTeller bools) which can have value `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `MAYBE`. For example, `info.IsCharacter(Josef, IMP)` will evaluate to `MAYBE` if Josef is the Recluse, allowing the propogation of uncertainty due to Storyteller decisions.
