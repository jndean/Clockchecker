"""
Implementing a Character Checklist:
 - Copy some other similar-ish character.
 - For basic info characters, just create a Ping class inheriting from
   Info and implement the __call__ method.
 - For more complex characters or characters who have to make choices that are
   not evidenced by a Ping, override the relevant character methods such as
   [modify_category_counts, run_night/day/setup, killed, executed, etc.].
 - For characetrs that do things publicly in the day, consider implementing an
   Event instead of a Ping.
 - When overriding the default methods for complex characters, remember to
   consider the desired behaviour of the new character if they are:
    - dead
    - droisoned
    - not their usual alignment
    - not the character who gets their claimed ping (Some TODO!)
    - spent
    - vortoxed
    - vigormortised, exorcised
 - Remember to set or call the following as appropriately
    - set `character.spent`
    - call `player.woke()` for Chambermaid if character uses using WakePattern.MANUAL
    - call `state.math_misregistration` for Mathematician counts
    - TODO: call `state.choose(target)` for Goon
   - If you use maybe_activate_effects, check if you should maybe_deactivate_effects
     before the next night.
